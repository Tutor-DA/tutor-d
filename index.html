    <h2>Our Interactive Platform</h2>
    <p>
      At <strong>TutorDA</strong>, our digital learning environment is designed to provide an enriched and flexible educational experience by integrating the best of <strong>eLearning and blended learning models</strong>. Through our powerful online platform, students not only attend structured live classes but also gain access to a self-paced digital ecosystem that enhances conceptual understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the core components of our platform is the <strong>Moodle Learning Management System (LMS)</strong>, where students complete dynamic quizzes and assignments. Using <strong>random number generation</strong> in problem sets, we ensure that no two students get the exact same set of questions — giving them endless opportunities for practice and reducing rote learning.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Moodle LMS</strong> enables personalized quizzes, instant feedback, and progress tracking.</li>
      <li><strong>Blended Learning</strong> combines real-time teacher interaction with digital content and activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Randomized assessments</strong> offer unique versions of questions to every student.</li>
      <li><strong>WhatsApp Support</strong> ensures students can instantly connect with tutors for help and guidance.</li>
      <li><strong>Interactive Digital Boards</strong> simulate classroom teaching with real-time demonstrations and annotations.</li>
      <li><strong>Virtual Library Access</strong> provides curated math resources, e-books, and solution manuals.</li>
      <li><strong>Mathematical Models</strong> are used to visually demonstrate concepts such as geometry, calculus, and algebra.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Our mission is to build a collaborative, tech-integrated classroom that not only supports learning but also inspires innovation and curiosity in mathematics.
